    <p>Welcome to Best Buy. The BestBuy.com website, Best Buy mobile and iPad apps, and our mobile Best Buy site are collectively the “Best Buy Properties” and each individually is a “Best Buy Property.” By using any Best Buy Property and its related services, products, and software, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions (“Terms”). You also accept the Terms when you create an account, make a purchase as a guest, or log in to any Best Buy Property. Additional or separate terms may apply to your interactions with other Best Buy websites, Best Buy or Geek Squad® locations, and to your use of individual services or features available on a Best Buy Property, such as reviews. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. References to “Best Buy,” “Geek Squad,” “Magnolia,” “Magnolia Home Theater,” “Magnolia Design Center,” “Pacific Sales,” “our,” “we,” or “us” may refer to Best Buy Co., Inc., BestBuy.com, LLC, Best Buy Stores, L.P., BBY Solutions, Inc., Best Buy Enterprise Services, Inc., Magnolia Hi-Fi, LLC, Pacific Sales Kitchen and Bath Centers, LLC, and their affiliates, subsidiaries, and designees.
